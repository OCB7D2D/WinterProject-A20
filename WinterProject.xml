Welcome to the Winterween Project by sphereii and xyth, the unholy combination of Winter Project and the ancient Valoween!

Not wanting to miss an alpha, we've combined two of the most dramatic mods into a single mod for Alpha 20.

Steel your nerves. Steady your hands. Keep your wits about you, and you just may survive Winterween...

We invite you to once more explore a special sphereii-mental release, and challenge yourself to unlock its secrets.

Special thanks goes to Mumpfy for his texturing work.
